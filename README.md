# SMTP Credentials Checker
This repository contains a Python script to verify the validity of SMTP credentials. During penetration testing activities, I often encounter SMTP credentials and struggle to find a reliable tool to confirm their validity. To simplify this task, I developed this straightforward script to send emails using your local setup.

If you find my work helpful and would like to show your support, you can buy me a coffee! â˜•
