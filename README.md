# SMTP-Credentials-Checker
This repository contains a Python script designed to verify the validity of SMTP credentials. During penetration testing activities, I often encounter SMTP credentials and struggle to find a reliable tool to confirm their validity. To simplify this task, I developed this straightforward script.

## Features
- **Simple and Easy to Use:** Just provide the SMTP server, port, username, and password to check the credentials.
- **Quick Validation:** Efficiently checks if the provided SMTP credentials are valid.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Lightweight with minimal external dependencies, making it easy to set up and run.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imusabkhan/smtp-credentials-checker.git
   cd smtp-credentials-checker
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python check_smtp_credentials.py
   ```
